# Algorithms and Data Structure in Javascript

### In node environment

At this point there is no node_modules. Just: 

```
npm start
```

### In browser

In order to check algorithm results in browser, I highly recommend you to use Parcel bundler 

```
npm i -g parcel-bundler
```

So now, all you need to do is to run following command in the root of this project

```
parcel index.html
```

and it works like a charm.
