### Fractal tree
One of the interesting use of recursion is fractal tree. See code in fractal-tree.js and do not forget to
include it in index.html (maybe its already included).

### Ideas to improve tree
1. Dynamic width of branch. The less length, the less width of the branch.
2. Colors. Last branches have green color
3. Random angle for branch. It gives more realistic look to our tree.
4. Random length for branch. Same reason.
